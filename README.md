# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion card coding challenge](/images/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a front-end coding challenge I followed through [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges to improve my skills as Junior Frontend developer.

**To do this challenge,  basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript is required**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

As expected, users are  able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked


## Deploying the project

This project was deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
